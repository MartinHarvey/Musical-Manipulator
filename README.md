#This project uses:

The excellent <a href = https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub> pyDub </a> by jiaaro forms the core of this program. It handles all of the heavy lifting in a very easy to use, high-level syntax. It is easy to install and the source code is availible on GitHub.

The UI elements of this project are provided by Tkinter, a set of modules that (AFAIK) are available out of the box with Python, and exists as the de-facto standard for creating interfaces in Python. It allows you to create professional and easy to understand GUIs, which are far better than controlling a program via the command line.
